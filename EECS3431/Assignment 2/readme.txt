Requirements Completed:

1. At least one two-level hierarchical object (e.g. human arm).

We have 2 humanoid characters with arms and legs that are controlled via object field modifications

2. At least one texture either procedurally generated or mapped.

Several textures are present and dynamically modified - faces on two people, ground plane, rock, and tornado effect

3. At least one shader edited or designed from scratch to perform a clearly visible effect.

Shader exhibits texture sliding to create a tornado effect. Texture RGB values are moved around independently relative to elapsed time
Texture blue colour value is also moved up and down the y axis for extra effect.

4. 360 degrees camera fly around using lookAt() and setMV().

Camera movements are performed. Multiple zooms, pans, 1 lookAt orbit in scene 2, and 1 camera position orbit in scene 4

5. Connection to real-time. You should make sure that your scene runs in real-time on fast enough
machines. Real-time means that one simulated second corresponds roughly to one real second.

All movements are relative to provided TIME variable

6. You should display the frame rate of your program in the console window or the graphics window
once every 2 seconds.

Frame rate is displayed in console window every 2 seconds

7. Make and submit a movie of your animation. The movie should be about 512x512 and in a standard
format, such as mp4. Include a cover image (png or jpg) of 100x100 pixels. You may use any screen
capture program that is available.

movie.mp4

8. Provide a readme.txt that describes what you have done, what you have omitted, and any other
information that will help the grader evaluation your work, including what is stated below.

shader.html was edited to support texture sliding along the textured object. 
All listed criteria are satisfied.
readme.txt present


ADDITIONAL EVALUATION
9. Complexity: scene setup and design, movement of animated elements, and programming.

Scenes involves multiple moving parts and object oriented classes to make movement easier
Multiple sections of animation split up into 4 different scenes, smooth animation of movements 
based off of real-time intervals, as well as well-formatted and documented code.

10. Creativity: story telling, scene design, object appearance and other artistic elements.

Narrative progression of animation with each scene designed to highlight a specific aspect of the story. 
Object appearances designed to be distinct and eye-catching.

11. Quality: Attention to detail, modeling quality, rendering quality, motion control.

Attention to detail mantained through exact interval planning for each section of animations 
even within the same scenes.

12. Programming style.

Code is organized and made using variables to adjust object positions and animations easily and 
effeciently for testing and potential changes and fine-tuning.
